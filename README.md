# Bet.Me Coding Test

Taking a command line argument (URL of a single data file) to get information related to sports in CSV format, the script parses this information and finally outputs to the console the result which is the data structured as mutiple JSON objects. This is also saved to a .txt file for viewing at a later date.

## How to run:

- Navigate to the project directory
- Once in the project directory open a terminal window here
- Type `python3 parse-data.py ARG`
  - `ARG` being the url of the CSV file from [https://www.football-data.co.uk/](https://www.football-data.co.uk/)
